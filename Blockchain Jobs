Sorry everyone, this is not a new file but a shout out for jobs as we are Blockchain Rec - specialists in recruitment in this space. 
As the community and commercial experience is relatively low in this area, I am reaching out to the GitHub community. 
Clients of mine are seeking UK based developers with experience of contributing to the Hyperledger Composer project(s). 
Please feel free to report this file and have it taken off if you feel it is wrong. I am just trying to reach out to the available discussion platforms. 
Either way, keep up the good work community! Everything coming out of here is awesome!
